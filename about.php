			A small company started up by the Infamous John Warren
			on his quest to spread the Arts. In this one-man-show
			many timeless classics have been performed such as 
			"King John", and "John and Juliet". Through his innovative
			style, and shining personality he has been able to overcome 
			the typical challenges of requiring	many actors on stage at 
			once for a performance. If you're passionate about theatre
			then book your tickets today!
